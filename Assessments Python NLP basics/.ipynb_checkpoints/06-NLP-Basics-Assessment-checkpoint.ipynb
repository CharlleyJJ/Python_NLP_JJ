      "men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they\n",
      "merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it.\n",

      "hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar\n",
      "of his well fitting frock coat.  , He wore a moustache and pointed\n",
      "beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a\n",
      "kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose\n",
      "neck was in the hemp.  , Evidently this was no vulgar assassin.  , The\n",

      "a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.\n",
      ", He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--\n",
      ", it seemed both.  , Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the\n",
      "tolling of a death knell.  , He awaited each new stroke with impatience\n",
      ", and--he knew not why--apprehension.  , The intervals of silence grew\n",
      "progressively longer; the delays became maddening.  , With their greater\n",
      "infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness.  , They hurt\n",
      ", his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek.  , What he\n",
      "heard was the ticking of his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      ", He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.  , \"If I could\n",
